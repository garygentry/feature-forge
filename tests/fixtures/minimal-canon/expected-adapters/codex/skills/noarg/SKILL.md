# No Arg

A forge-init analog: no metadata.argument-hint, so the Claude mirror must NOT
invent a top-level argument-hint, and no own references/ dir is copied.

## Host execution notes (Codex)

This skill was authored Claude-first; the body above refers to "the host's question mechanism", "the host's subagent mechanism", and "the host's background-execution mechanism". On Codex:

- **User input:** Codex has no structured question tool — ask the question directly and wait for the user's reply before proceeding. Never skip a required question or assume an answer.
- **Subagents:** spawn a Codex subagent using the named custom agent under `.codex/agents/<name>.toml`. Codex spawns a subagent only when explicitly asked; if the custom agent is unavailable, run that step inline yourself.
- **Background / monitoring:** run long-lived runner commands in your shell session and report progress as it arrives — there is no Claude-style background or monitoring tool to arm.
