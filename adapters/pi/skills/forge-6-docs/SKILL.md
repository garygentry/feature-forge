# forge-6-docs — Architecture Documentation Generator

Generate developer-focused architecture documentation for a feature, suitable for onboarding, reference, and maintenance.

## Prerequisites

Read and follow `references/shared-conventions.md` for feature name validation, configuration reading, and force mode handling before proceeding.

**Turn structure reminder:** Output analysis/context as text, then route ALL questions through `AskUserQuestion`. Never embed questions in text output — the user will not be prompted and the session will stall.

## Step 1: Read Context

Resolve the feature directory via the **Feature Directory Resolution** block in `references/shared-conventions.md` (so a standalone feature resolves to its flat `{specsDir}/{feature}/` path exactly as today, and an epic member resolves to its nested path). Use the resulting `{resolvedFeatureDir}` everywhere this skill previously wrote `{specsDir}/{feature}/`.

Read `{resolvedFeatureDir}/.pipeline-state.json` to understand what exists.

### Gather Sources

Load into context:
1. **Specs**: PRD.md, tech-spec.md, all implementation specs
2. **Implementation**: Read the actual source code for this feature's package
3. **Existing docs**: Check `{docsDir}/` for other features' docs to match conventions
4. **README**: Check if the feature package has its own README.md

### Implementation Completeness Check

Check `{resolvedFeatureDir}/backlog.json` (or `{backlogDir}/{feature}/backlog.json` if configured). Count items with status `complete` vs total. If implementation is less than 80% complete, use `AskUserQuestion` to warn: "Implementation is only N% complete. Documentation will be based primarily on specs and may need updates after implementation. Proceed?" If user proceeds, add a `PRE-IMPLEMENTATION` notice at the top of each generated doc.

Also check `.pipeline-state.json` for `stages.forge-5-loop`. If it exists and has status `in-progress` (some items incomplete), include this in the warning: "The rauf loop has not fully completed — {done}/{total} items done. Documentation may need updates after remaining items are implemented."

### Impl-Verify Backstop

Check `.pipeline-state.json` for `stages.forge-verify-impl`. If it is **absent** or has status `"skipped"`, use `AskUserQuestion` to warn with the cost of skipping: "Implementation hasn't been verified yet. Recommended: run `/skill:forge-verify {feature} impl` first to audit the loop's output — docs generated over unverified code can document bugs or gaps as if they were intended behavior, and readers will trust them. Generate docs anyway?" Offer **Verify first (recommended)** · **Generate docs anyway**. This mirrors `forge-4-backlog`'s pre-stage verification check and backstops a skipped impl-verify regardless of how the loop ended. If `stages.forge-verify-impl` shows it already ran (`findings-applied`, `findings-reported`, or `passed`), proceed with no warning.

### Epic-Level Documentation (epic members only)

If the resolved feature has an `epic` back-pointer in its `.pipeline-state.json`, run:

```bash
R="$(bash -c 'for d in "${FEATURE_FORGE_ROOT:-}" "$HOME"/.claude/skills/feature-forge "$HOME"/.claude/plugins/cache/*/feature-forge/* "$HOME"/.claude/plugins/*/feature-forge "$HOME"/.agents/skills/feature-forge ./.agents/skills/feature-forge; do [ -x "$d/scripts/forge-root.sh" ] && exec "$d/scripts/forge-root.sh"; done')"
[ -n "$R" ] || { echo "feature-forge: cannot locate plugin root" >&2; exit 1; }
python3 "$R/scripts/epic-manifest.py" render-status "{epic}" --specs-dir "{specsDir}" --json
```

If `render-status` fails, skip the epic-level offer and proceed with the per-feature docs only; surface the error per the exit-1/exit-2 split in the **Feature Directory Resolution** block of `references/shared-conventions.md` (exit 1 → parse `{findings[]}` from stdout; exit 2 → surface the plain `Error:` stderr line verbatim).

**Only if `rollup.total > 0 AND rollup.complete == rollup.total`** (every member is complete-for-orchestration; the `total > 0` guard excludes an empty epic), offer the extra doc as a statement the user can take or leave — not a forced question:

"All {total} features in the '{epic}' epic are complete. I can also generate an **epic-level architecture document** spanning the features, alongside {feature}'s per-feature docs — say the word and I'll add it."

If the user asks for it, synthesize a doc at **`{docsDir}/{epic}/`** sourced from: the `EPIC.md` narrative, each member's per-feature docs, and the manifest contracts (each feature's `exposes`/`consumes`). When the epic-level doc is written, the Step 5 commit also stages `{docsDir}/{epic}/`.

If not all members are complete (or the feature has no `epic` back-pointer), **do not offer** — the per-feature doc flow proceeds unchanged.

Read `references/doc-conventions.md` for documentation standards.

## Step 2: Plan Documentation Structure

Based on feature complexity and existing doc conventions, propose a doc plan:

**Minimum (simple feature):**
```
{docsDir}/{feature}/
├── README.md          — Overview, quick start, key concepts
└── api-reference.md   — Exported APIs, types, configuration
```

**Standard (typical feature):**
```
{docsDir}/{feature}/
├── README.md          — Overview, quick start, key concepts
├── architecture.md    — Design decisions, data flow, component relationships
├── api-reference.md   — Exported APIs, types, configuration
└── guides/
    └── integration.md — How to integrate this feature into an app
```

**Comprehensive (complex feature):**
```
{docsDir}/{feature}/
├── README.md          — Overview, quick start, key concepts
├── architecture.md    — Design decisions, data flow, component relationships
├── api-reference.md   — Exported APIs, types, configuration
├── configuration.md   — All configuration options with examples
├── guides/
│   ├── getting-started.md  — Step-by-step setup
│   ├── integration.md      — How to integrate with other packages
│   └── troubleshooting.md  — Common issues and solutions
└── decisions/
    └── adr-001-*.md   — Architecture decision records (if significant decisions were made)
```

Present the plan as a statement and invite edits before writing — not a forced confirmation gate: "Here's the doc plan I'll generate. Tell me if you want to add, remove, or restructure any documents; otherwise I'll proceed." Write the docs unless the user asks for changes.

## Step 3: Write Documentation

### Key Principles

**Write for the reader, not the writer.**
- A developer encountering this feature for the first time should be able to understand it from the docs alone
- Lead with the "what" and "why" before the "how"
- Include code examples for every exported API
- Don't assume familiarity with the spec documents

**Be accurate to the implementation, not the spec.**
- If the implementation diverged from the spec, document the implementation
- Specs are the source of truth for design intent; code is the source of truth for behavior
- Read the actual source code to verify your documentation is correct

**Don't cite or link spec files in the generated docs.**
- Read the specs freely for context, but the docs you write are shipped implementation artifacts — they must be self-contained
- Never link or reference `PRD.md`, `tech-spec.md`, or the numbered implementation specs (`specs/{feature}/NN-*.md`); these are pre-implementation artifacts that may be archived or deleted
- Reference only the code, runtime contracts/configuration, and other generated docs. If you need to convey design intent, write it directly into the doc rather than pointing at a spec

**Match existing conventions.**
- If other features' docs use a specific heading structure, follow it
- If they include diagrams, include diagrams
- If they use a specific tone (formal, casual, tutorial-style), match it

### README.md Structure

```markdown
# {Feature Name}

{One-paragraph description of what this feature does and why it exists.}

## Quick Start

{Minimal code to get started — import, configure, use.}

## Key Concepts

{Explain the domain model and core abstractions in plain language.}

## Package Exports

{Table of subpath exports and what each contains.}

| Export / Entry Point | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| `{module}` | Shared types and utilities |
| `{module}/server` | Server-side functionality |
| ...    | ... |

Adapt export paths to match the project's module/package conventions.

## Configuration

{Key configuration options with defaults.}

## Further Reading

- [Architecture](./architecture.md) — Design decisions and data flow
- [API Reference](./api-reference.md) — Complete API documentation
- [Integration Guide](./guides/integration.md) — How to use with other packages
```

## Step 4: Review with User

Present the docs as text. Then use `AskUserQuestion` to collect feedback — do NOT include these questions in your text output:

"1. Does this accurately reflect the implementation? 2. Is the level of detail appropriate for your team? 3. Any areas that need more explanation?"

## Step 5: Update Pipeline State and Commit

Write pipeline state conforming to `references/pipeline-state-schema.json`.

1. Update `{resolvedFeatureDir}/.pipeline-state.json`:
   - Set `currentStage` to `complete`
   - Record `artifacts`
   - Set `stages.forge-6-docs.basedOnVersions` to include versions for all completed upstream stages. Always include forge-1-prd, forge-2-tech, forge-3-specs. Include forge-4-backlog and forge-5-loop ONLY if they have status `complete`.
2. If `gitCommitAfterStage` is true, follow the Git Commit Protocol in `references/shared-conventions.md`: stage files (`git add {docsDir}/{feature}/ {resolvedFeatureDir}/` — and **also** `{docsDir}/{epic}/` when an epic-level doc was written in Step 1), attempt commit with message `"{commitPrefix}({feature}): complete architecture docs"` (marking `stages.forge-6-docs.status` `complete` with `commitHash: null` in that commit), then record the artifact-commit hash via the protocol's two-commit follow-up (never `--amend`) only on success. If commit fails, leave status as `in-progress`.
4. Tell user: "Documentation complete. Feature pipeline for '{feature}' is finished!\n  `/skill:forge {feature}` to see the final pipeline status." Then **hand off to the next unit of work** — do not dead-end here (Issue #124):

   - **Epic member** (the resolved feature has an `epic` back-pointer in its `.pipeline-state.json`): reuse the `render-status "{epic}" --specs-dir "{specsDir}" --json` output from Step 1's Epic-Level Documentation block (re-run it if you skipped that block). If `actionable` is non-empty, point at the next member: "Epic '{epic}' has {total−complete} feature(s) left — next up: **{actionable[0].name}**. Start it with `{actionable[0].nextCommand}`." (Offer to start it now if the host can invoke it — honor `autoInvokeNextStage` + `Skill`-tool availability; else just print the command.) If `actionable` is empty but the epic is not fully complete, note the remaining members are blocked on dependencies. If the epic is fully complete (`rollup.complete == rollup.total`, `total > 0`), congratulate on the whole epic — the epic-level architecture doc was already offered in Step 1 — and point at `/skill:forge {epic}` for the finished dashboard.
   - **Standalone** (no `epic` back-pointer): offer the next feature — "Start a new feature: `/skill:forge-1-prd <feature-name>` (or group several with `/skill:forge-0-epic <epic-name>`). Run `/skill:forge` to see any other active pipelines." Defer the full recency-ranked list of other pipelines to the navigator (`/skill:forge`) rather than duplicating it here.

## Gotchas

- Don't just rephrase the specs. Documentation should explain the implemented system, not the planned system. Read the actual code.
- Don't cite spec files (PRD.md, tech-spec.md, numbered specs) as sources or "further reading" in the generated docs — specs are pre-implementation artifacts that may not survive. Keep the docs self-contained; link only to code, configuration, and other docs.
- If the implementation doesn't exist yet (backlog hasn't been run), document based on specs but note prominently that docs are pre-implementation and may need updating.
- API reference should include actual function signatures from the code, not from the spec (they may differ).
- Don't generate docs that will immediately be stale. Focus on concepts, architecture, and patterns rather than line-by-line code walkthroughs.
- Include "When to use" and "When NOT to use" sections — they save developers more time than any other documentation pattern.

## Host execution notes (Pi)

This Pi bundle preserves Claude's `AskUserQuestion` references because it ships a Pi compatibility extension registering an `AskUserQuestion` tool. On Pi:

- **User input:** use `AskUserQuestion` for genuine user decisions. It supports multiple questions, option descriptions, recommended ordering, multi-select, previews, and free-form Other/custom answers.
- **Skill dispatch:** Pi uses `/skill:<name>` commands. If you cannot invoke a skill directly, print the exact `/skill:<name> ...` command for the user to run.
- **Subagents:** this bundle declares its custom agents (`forge-researcher`, `forge-spec-writer`, `forge-verifier`) as package agents. If a `subagent` tool is registered, dispatch one with `{ agent: "forge-verifier", task: "..." }`, or fan several out concurrently with `{ tasks: [{ agent: "forge-spec-writer", task: "..." }, ...] }`. If no `subagent` tool is available, run that step inline yourself.
- **Background / monitoring:** run long-lived commands in the foreground and report progress as it arrives.
